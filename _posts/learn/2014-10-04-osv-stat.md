## All Cloudius OSv binaries collect and send data at each boot

Starting from OSv v0.15, all [downloadable binary](downloads) and OSv
[Virtual Appliances](virtual-appliances) send basic information at boot
to a centralize remote log.

We do this to collect usage metrics in order to allocate resources correctly.

If you build OSv from source, the monitoring agent is not enabled by default.

## Monitoring message at boot

At boot time, the following message will be written to OSv dmesg log file:

```
This version of OSv will send a report each time it is booted to Cloudius Systems. For more on information collected, how and why it is stored, and how to disable reporting, see osv.io/osv-stat
```

## Data reported

 * A randomly generated UUID for each boot

 * Operating system name, always "OSv" (`/os/name`)

 * OSv version

 * Date

 * Total memory

 * Free memory at boot time

 * Command run at boot (`/os/cmdline`)

 * Hypervisor used

 * Processor count, if available

 * JVM version (if installed)


## Disabling monitoring

You can disable the monitoring system in cloud-init, starting with OSv version 0.15 beta.  Use this configuration:

	monitor-agent:
		enable: false

You can also [build OSv from source yourself](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv)
